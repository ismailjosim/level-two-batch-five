🚀 findOne VS findById
👉 normally we get this method to do Mongoose CRUD Operations
Model.create()
Model.findOne()
Model.findById()
Model.findOneAndUpdate()
Model.findByIdAndUpdate()
Model.findOneAndDelete()
Model.findByIdAndDelete()

Question => when should we use findOne() and findById()?
👉 findOne() is used when we want to find a document based on some condition other than Mongodb default _id
👉 findById() is used when we want to find a document based on the _id field

Question => when should we use findOneAndUpdate() and findByIdAndUpdate()?
👉 findOneAndUpdate() is used when we want to update a document based on some condition other than Mongodb default _id.
👉 findByIdAndUpdate() is used when we want to update a document based on the _id field

Note => but we can use _id field in findOneAndUpdate() as well, but it is not recommended to use it because it is not the best practice to use _id field in findOneAndUpdate() method.
