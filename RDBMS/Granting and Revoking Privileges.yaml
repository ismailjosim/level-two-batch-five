# by default user don't have any privileges
# Granting and Revoking Privileges we can use GRANT and REVOKE commands
# GRANT command is used to give privileges to users
# REVOKE command is used to take back privileges from users
# GRANT command syntax
# GRANT privilege_type ON object_type object_name TO user_name; for example:
grant all privileges on table test_table to josim;

# REVOKE command syntax
REVOKE privilege_type ON object_type object_name FROM user_name;

# To insert or add data we need to first connect to the database:
\c josim
josim=# \d
          List of relations
 Schema |    Name    | Type  | Owner
--------+------------+-------+-------
 public | test_table | table | josim
(1 row)


josim=# insert into test_table(name) values('ismail');
INSERT 0 1


grant all privileges on table test_table to user1;
# now we can connect to the database with user1
# and insert data into the table
# user1 can insert data into the table
# but user1 can't drop the table
# user1 can't drop the table

# remove all privileges from user;
revoke all privileges on table test_table from user1;

# similar to that we can create roles and grant privileges to roles
# and then we can assign roles to users

create role role1;

# now we can grant privileges to role1
grant select on all tables in schema public to role1;

GRANT;

# now we can assign role1 to user1
grant role1 to user1;
